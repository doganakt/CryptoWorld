# CryptoWorld Project

The aim of the project is to examine specific cryptocurrencies' certain parameters and historical data that the user will want, to make purchase-sell proposals in certain time periods and to present all the data belonging to the user wallet in detail.

Now, the code creates the wallet, analyzes historical data of the designated coins, and gives some hints like purchasing suggestions or statistics. Also, the codes makes regression analysis to estimate the trend for short and long terms. After all, the user can provide buying/selling input to the program and the code updates the wallet.

Currencies' historical data are retrieved from Yahoo Finance. Price data are acquired from Excel's built-in function.

The project has the following assumptions:

- Instant selling and buying prices of the currencies are equal.
- The user, or trader, is reasonable person. For example, s/he does not make buy and sell transaction in the same run; or, s/he does not sell the amount of currency bigger than the one in the wallet.

I aim in the future that the code will make detailed RSI and MACD analysis to determine the trend, and it will give more hints related to these. Also, to retrieve the historical values of the currencies lively is my goal for future.

Doğan AKTAŞ.
